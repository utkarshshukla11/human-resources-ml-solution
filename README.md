🏢 Employee Retention Prediction – Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict which employees are likely to leave, helping HR teams take action to retain valuable talent.

💡 Why This Project Matters
Hiring and keeping employees is challenging — it costs time, money, and effort.
Small business owners spend nearly 40% of their working hours on non-revenue tasks like hiring.
Companies spend 15–20% of a new employee's salary just to recruit them.
Hiring takes an average of 52 days, and companies can lose 1–2.5% of total revenue during onboarding.
By predicting attrition, organizations can save costs, improve productivity, and retain top talent.

🧑‍💻 My Role
Acting as a Data Scientist, I worked with HR-provided employee data to:

Analyze patterns in attrition.
Build predictive models using machine learning.
Provide actionable insights to prevent employee turnover.
