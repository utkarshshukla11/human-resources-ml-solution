# 🏢 Employee Retention Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict which employees are likely to leave, helping HR teams take action to retain valuable talent.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Matters
- Hiring and keeping employees is challenging — it costs time, money, and effort.
- Small business owners spend nearly 40% of their working hours on non-revenue tasks like hiring.
- Companies spend 15–20% of a new employee's salary just to recruit them.
- Hiring takes an average of 52 days, and companies can lose 1–2.5% of total revenue during onboarding.

By predicting attrition, organizations can save costs, improve productivity, and retain top talent.
