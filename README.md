# 🏢 Employee Retention Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Objective
Employee attrition is costly and disruptive. **This project leverages machine learning to predict which employees are likely to leave**, enabling HR teams to take proactive steps and retain valuable talent.  

By understanding attrition patterns, organizations can **save costs, improve productivity, and retain top performers**.

---

## 💡 Why This Project Matters
Hiring and retaining employees is challenging and expensive:  

- ⏱ Small business owners spend **~40% of their working hours** on non-revenue tasks like hiring  
- 💰 Companies spend **15–20% of a new employee's salary** on recruitment  
- 📅 Hiring takes an average of **52 days**, and onboarding can cause a **1–2.5% revenue loss**  
- 🔍 Predictive insights allow HR to **act before attrition occurs**, saving time and money  

> Accurate attrition prediction empowers companies to **retain experienced talent** and improve overall organizational efficiency.
